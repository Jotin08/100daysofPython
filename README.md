# 100daysofPython

This repo will be a place where I store my first 100 python projects.

Day1 - I created a simple Band Name Generator. This tested fundamental python skills such as: assigning varibles, print, concat., input, etc.

Day2- I creaed a Tip Calculator

Day3- Begin working on flow control and logical operators. Ended the day by creating a little game.
